# 3D Model Viewer

3D Model Viewer renders 3D models using a custom game engine developed by
Pilgrimage Games. It serves as a basic demonstration of the 3D capabilities of
the proprietary engine.

[![Demo](demo.webp)](https://youtu.be/xh3sMvgR8wY)

All code has been written from scratch in-house following "handmade"
principles, with minimal use of external libraries and other dependencies. The
only exception to this is [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for
the GUI. In lieu of even the C standard library, Pilgrimage Games maintains its
own internal common library.

While 3D Model Viewer is open-source, the underlying game engine and its
various graphics backends, as well as internal library and platform code,
remain closed-source. See
[Releases](https://github.com/pilgrimage-games/3d-model-viewer/releases) to
download and run the application.

## Features
* Physically-based rendering (PBR) with support for base color,
metallic-roughness, normal, and emissive textures
* Support for non-opaque materials (via translucency sorting)
* Support for animation, including skeletal animation (via mesh skinning)
* Custom renderers for all modern PC graphics APIs (Direct3D 11, Direct3D 12,
and Vulkan)
* Bindless rendering and custom texture cache (Direct3D 12/Vulkan)
* Support for arbitrary display resolutions, refresh rates, and aspect ratios
* Support for Steam Deck and other Linux-based devices via Proton
* Arcball camera (camera is rotated on a sphere around the model)
* Mouse/keyboard and gamepad controls for model selection, rotation, zoom, etc.
* Immediate-mode GUI for displaying performance metrics, controls, etc.
* Wireframe mode

## Models
The included 3D models are processed from their original glTF 2.0 binary format
(.glb) and packed into a single Pilgrimage Games Assets (.pga) file.
